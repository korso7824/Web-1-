  <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Langauge (HTML)</a> is the standard markup langauge for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.</p>
  <br>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) resource is the main markup language for displaying web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of the HTML web page.
  The elements consist of a pair of tags (starting and ending tags) and the textual or graphical content inside of the tags.
  <p style="margin-top:45px;">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
  Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards,
  has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]</p>
  Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML.
  <img src="coding.jpg" width="100">
  <p style="margin-top;50px;">It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the grammar.[9][10]
  The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes.
  Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.[11]</p>
